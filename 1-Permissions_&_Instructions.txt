----####--------R&D FORTRAN CODE--------####---
----####--------------------------------####---

1) The UMAT has been updated since the initial publication, and since it is academic code it may not be
optimize, and some bugs may accour, caution in the final results is advise.

2) The UMAT was initialty formulated only for 2D.

3) Future versions of this UMAT will be posted without warning.

4) The Jacobian is written in terms of secant matrix (not tangent matrix),
therefore it is not expected an quadratic convergence when using ABAQUS standard,
and it is recomended to reduce some iterative criteria (in the step module) to allow convergence.

5) This UMAT code was been discontinued to superior version for 3D and 2D analysis in the same UMAT file.
A new version of this UMAT will be publish soon in a research paper, and then the code will be public.

----####------RUNNING INSTRUCTIONS------####---
----####--------------------------------####---

1) This is an UMAT made for ABAQUS 2022, using Intel Fortran Compiler 2016 for Windows 10.

2) The original code is in Fortran 90, and is not ready to run in classical ABAQUS linked with FORTRAN 77 flags, 
these need to be modified depending on the chosen compiler.
For this reason, the UMAT is already compiled into an .OBJ file for windows use and .O for linux use.

3) This can be used directly in the “command line or power shell” in windows user=umat.obj or in linux user=umat.o

4) For linux the .O object files was compiled using gfortran (from GNU project), 
it may not work with Linux Intel Compiler during the final LINKING.

5) Example on how to run a job with object files in ABAQUS
-Example in CMD “command line” for windows 10:
abaqus job=example cpus=2 user=umat.obj

-Example in terminal for linux:
abaqus job=example cpus=2 user=umat.o
